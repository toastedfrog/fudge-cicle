Feature 1: save method saves the list to disk (default:"<listname>.todo"); load reconstitutes the data back into an object. Data persistence!
*.save # Optionally pass a filename string
*.load # Optionally pass a filename string
Feature 2: List items can be referred to by their number in the list (integer) OR by their item description (string). This provides index-independence for all the items.
Feature 3: List items can be sorted by their description and by their complete state (incomplete first). Extremely helpful to see what you have...to do!
*.sort_description
*.sort_complete
